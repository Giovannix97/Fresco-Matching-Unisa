## What is "Anastylosis" &#127912;

Anastylosis is a restoration technique in which a ruined building or monument is restored using the original architectural elements to the greatest degree possible. It is widely used in many fields of archeology and cultural heritage. Each recovered componentâ€™s proper placement must be determine, and replacement materials that are used must be limited to those that are necessary for stability. 

## The Problem &#129327;

Often, when an archaeologist discovers a new fresco or monument it can be in a very bad state. For example, a fresco can be divided in many fragments of severals forms and sizes.

## The Goal &#127919;

The aim of the project is to use IT tools to help and support the process described above. Later will be introduced some techniques to face the problem and to achieve an acceptable result.
